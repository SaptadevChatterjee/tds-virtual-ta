    "content": "Hello Sir,\n\nI understand from the email we received that there are three mock ROEs scheduled. I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\n\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\n\nThanks and Regards\nShalini",

      "content": "It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\n\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\n\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\n\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\n\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\n\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\n\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\n\nKind regards",
