      "content": "In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .\n\nFor example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .\n\nSame goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.",
