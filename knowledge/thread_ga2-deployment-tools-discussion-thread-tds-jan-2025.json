Since ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs, double-check that the ngrok URL is correct before submitting.\n\nFor Question 9, did you enable CORS? To verify, check your browser console—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue.\n\nimage\n724×136 18.3 KB\n\nFor question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally.\n\nKind regards.",
