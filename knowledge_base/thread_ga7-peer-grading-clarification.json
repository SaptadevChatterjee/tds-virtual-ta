    "content": "@carlton Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.\n\nPlease help me out on what to do. Thanks.\n\nimage\n1756×1156 149 KB\n\nUpon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?\n\nimage\n1260×194 29.4 KB",
