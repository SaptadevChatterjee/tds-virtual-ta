From containerization to prompt tuning.\nBut I am personally offended by one thing…”\n\n“How dare you give bonus marks on Week 7?\nI skipped it — just like many — because we were told only best 4 of 7 would count.\nI demand justice. And a belly rub.”\n– , Full-stack Labrador & Part-time Therapist\n\n Moral of the story:\n\nLet your pets help with your coursework.\nYou get the grade. They get the rage.",
